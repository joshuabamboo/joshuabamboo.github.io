Okay, so you've [modified your keyboard to make the Caps Lock a more useful button](http://joshuabamboo.github.io/blog/2014/11/12/test/). Now, let's actually put that new Control(^) button to use.

##Here are my top 6 time-saving shortcuts I use constantly:

>  1. Control-a - Jumps to the beginning of a line. (Similarly, Control-e jumps to the end)
>  2. Shift-Command- ←or→ - Highlight the text to the left or right of your curser. This is particularly helpful when trying to delete, cut, or copy a line.
>  3. Control-r (in the Terminal) - Allows you to search your previous commands. Sort of like pressing the up arrow, but using a keyword search instead.
>  4. Function-Delete - Forward delete. When I switched from PC to Mac, this was the only thing I missed until I realized Macs (of course) have it, too.
>  5. Command-Control-Shift-4 - Copy screen grab to your clipboard. Before this trick, my Desktop was littered with random screenshots I saved to my computer only to drop them in an email or website.
>  6. Command-Tab - To switch between running programs. Tapping tab allows you to loop through (The directional pad serves the same function). Make your selection by releasing Command.

Although the benefits are marginal, marginal benefits add up quickly. 

###Let's make some (conservative) assumptions:

>  * As a programmer, you're on your computer 8 hours/day
>  * You probably use 5 keyboard shortcuts per hour
>  * Each keyboard shortcut nets 2 saved seconds

That's 29,200 seconds per year -- The equivalent of an entire work day!

(((10 seconds per hour * 8 hours * 365 days)/60)/60) = 8.11 hours

[Eve](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/44454/hotkey-eve) is a great learning tool that notifies you of the keyboard shortcut every time you do something with the curser.
