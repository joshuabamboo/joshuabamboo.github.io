Okay, so you've [modified your keyboard to make the Caps Lock a more useful button](http://joshuabamboo.github.io/blog/2014/11/12/test/). Now, let's actually put that new Control(^) button to use.

##Here are my top 5 time-saving shortcuts I use constantly:

1. Control-a - Jumps to the beginning of a line
2. Control-e - Jumps to the end of a line
3. Control-r (in the Terminal) - Allows you to search your previous commands. Sort of like pressing the up arrow, but using a keyword search instead.
4. Function-Delete - Forward delete. When I switched from PC to Mac, this was the only thing I missed until I realized Macs (of course) have it, too.
5. Command-Control-Shift-4 - Copy screen grab to your clipboard. Before this trick, my Desktop was littered with random screenshots I saved to my computer only to drop them in an email or website.

Although the benefits are marginal, marginal benefits add up quickly. 

###Let's make some (conservative) assumptions:

* As a programmer, you're on your computer 8 hours/day
* You probably use 5 keyboard shortcuts per hour
* Each keyboard shortcut nets 3 saved seconds

That's 15 seconds per hour -- Or over 12 hours per year!
((15 seconds per hour * 40 hours * 365 days)/60)/60
