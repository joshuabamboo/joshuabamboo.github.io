## 1. Only build what you need.
My partner and I spent the beginning of the week building out a user model, controller, and view. It was beautiful. You could make a user profile, and edit it. It was styled nicely. Only problem was: we weren't demoing user signup, and we definitely weren't editing a user's profile. Stick with what you need.

## 2. Fake it 'til you make it.
You're demoing your project locally. You're controlling what gets clicked. This is extremely convient for building an MVP. It doesn't have to be perfect. All the features don't have to be added. Build your cool feature, demo it, and polish it later. 

## 3. Don't frown on a tech talk
You don't have to build an app. Tech talks are extremely valuable for the audience. Also, as the presenter, it gives you the opportunity for a deeper understanding into a topic. 

## 4. Pre-record your demo
You won't need it (hopefully). But there will be sometime in your life when your app crashes. That time may be on a presenter stage. Be prepared.
