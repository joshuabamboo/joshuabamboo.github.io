For someone making the switch from Ruby to JavaScript, the first thing you may notice is JavaScript's ineligant obsession with semicolons. They're everywhere!

Here are some quick and dirty tips to determine whether or not that line should have a semicolon.

####DO use semicolons: 
   * After you assign something
   * After you call a function
   * After you return something

####DO NOT use semicolons: 
   * After an if statement
   * After a function expression

The good news: The browser will intelligently place semicolons if you forget one here and there.

The bad news: You can't rely on this. 

Still having problems wrapping your head around it? Pair program with a semicolon pro.
